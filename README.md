 Internship assignment for GoIbibo. I have used 2 approaches.
 
 1) In the first approach, I have used basic Python to read the text from file and then simply create a dictionary where key is the word and frequency is the value in the dictionary. Also I have **removed the stop words** from dictionary. Finally I have **displayed the top ten** most frequent words.
 
 2) In the second approach, I have used **Count Vectorizer from Scikit** to obtain the counts of various words. Also I have **removed stop words** in count vectorizer. Finally I have simply displayed **top 10 words** in this notebook as before.
